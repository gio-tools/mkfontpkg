# mkfontpkg

```shell
go install gio.tools/mkfontpkg@latest
```

This is a utility to create a new `gio-tools` repository from a `.zip` file containing a
font's source files (`OTF` or `TTF`).

It should be executed from within a directory that contains the `gio-tools/website` repo
and the desired (or existing) destination directory for the given font.
